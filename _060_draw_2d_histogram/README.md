Program to draw a 2D histogram

To run:

```
python ./histogram_2d.py --bins 100
```

A 2D histogram, also known as a density plot or a heat map, is a graphical 
representation of data that allows us to visualize the distribution of two 
variables at the same time. Here are some common use cases for a 2D histogram:

1. Data exploration and analysis: 2D histograms can help us identify patterns and correlations between two variables. For example, we can use a 2D histogram to analyze the relationship between temperature and rainfall in a specific region.

2. Image processing: 2D histograms can be used to analyze the distribution of pixel intensities in an image. This can be useful in image segmentation, object recognition, and feature extraction.

3. Machine learning: 2D histograms can be used as input features in machine learning algorithms. For example, a 2D histogram of the RGB values of an image can be used as a feature vector in image classification tasks.

4. Signal processing: 2D histograms can be used to analyze the distribution of signal amplitudes or frequencies in a signal processing application.

5. Quality control: 2D histograms can be used to monitor the quality of manufacturing processes by analyzing the distribution of defect sizes and locations in a product.

Overall, 2D histograms are a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing 
two-dimensional data, and can be used in a wide range of applications across 
various fields.
