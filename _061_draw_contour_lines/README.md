Program to draw contour lines

To run:

```
python ./contour_lines.py --level 100
```

Contour lines are lines on a map or graph that connect points of equal 
elevation or value, and are commonly used to represent topography or other 
continuous data. Here are some common use cases for contour lines:

1. Topographic mapping: Contour lines are commonly used in topographic maps to represent the elevation of the land surface. By showing the shape and elevation of the land, contour lines can be used for navigation, hiking, and outdoor recreation.

2. Geological mapping: Contour lines can be used to represent geological features such as rock formations, fault lines, and geological boundaries. By analyzing the shape and spacing of contour lines, geologists can gain insight into the structure and history of the Earth's crust.

3. Weather forecasting: Contour lines can be used to represent atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other weather-related variables. By analyzing the patterns and movement of contour lines on a weather map, meteorologists can make predictions about the future weather conditions.

4. Engineering and construction: Contour lines can be used to analyze the slope and drainage patterns of a site, which can be useful in designing buildings, roads, and other structures. By analyzing contour lines, engineers can also identify potential hazards such as landslides and floods.

5. Environmental management: Contour lines can be used to map the distribution of habitats, vegetation types, and other environmental features. By analyzing the patterns and relationships between contour lines and environmental variables, ecologists and conservationists can gain insights into the health and sustainability of ecosystems.

Overall, contour lines are a valuable tool for representing and analyzing 
spatial data, and can be used in a wide range of applications across 
various fields.
