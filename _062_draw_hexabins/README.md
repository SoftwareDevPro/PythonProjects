# Draws hexagons and shows hexabinning

Program to draw hexabinning

To run:

```
python ./hexabins.py --gridsize 10
```

Hexabinning is a technique for visualizing and analyzing data by dividing a 2D 
space into a grid of hexagons and counting the number of data points that fall 
into each hexagon. Here are some common use cases for hexabins:

1. Density estimation: Hexabinning can be used to estimate the density of data points in a scatter plot. By counting the number of data points in each hexagon, we can create a heatmap that shows the regions of high and low data density.

2. Data exploration: Hexabinning can be used to explore large datasets and identify patterns and trends in the data. By binning the data into hexagons, we can reduce the number of data points while preserving the overall structure of the data.

3. Spatial analysis: Hexabinning can be used to analyze spatial patterns in data, such as the distribution of crime incidents or the prevalence of a disease in a geographic area. By binning the data into hexagons, we can analyze the spatial distribution of the data and identify areas of high or low incidence.

4. Image processing: Hexabinning can be used to downsample or compress images by replacing groups of pixels with a single hexagon. This can reduce the file size of an image without significantly affecting its visual quality.

5. Machine learning: Hexabinning can be used as a preprocessing step for machine learning algorithms that require a fixed-size input. By binning the data into hexagons, we can create a fixed-size feature vector that captures the spatial structure of the data.

Overall, hexabinning is a flexible and powerful technique for analyzing and 
visualizing data, and can be used in a wide range of applications across 
various fields.
